## About The Project

The **MTN Transactions Dashboard** is a full-stack web application designed to **process, analyze, and visualize mobile money transactions** from **MTN MoMo SMS data**.

Users can interact with a **dynamic dashboard** that provides:

- üîç **Search & Filter**: Find transactions by type, date, or amount.
- üìä **Visualizations**: Interactive charts for transaction analysis.
- üìÑ **Transaction Details**: Click on transactions to view full details.
